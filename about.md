Hi, I'm a software engineer @ [Wayfair](https://github.com/wayfair) in Boston, currently building WMS software for Android devices. More in [résumé]({{ site.url }}/{{  site.baseurl }}/assets/parkgrantresume.pdf).

I like to talk about useful SDKs/libraries, design patterns/practices, and tools that make life easier. Also, I love anything regarding high-bandwidth HIDs and ergonomics, such as AR/VR devices and custom keyboards. 

Contact me at [granthpark@gmail.com](mailto:granthpark@gmail.com) or find me on [Github](https://github.com/grant-park).
