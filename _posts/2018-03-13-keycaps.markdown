I bought "Blank Black PBT Keycaps" from [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1652).

Unfortunately, they were dark grey in color. I really like deep black, and I've had to dye my own Cherry ML keycaps in the past because no one makes blank black ML keycaps nowadays. I didn't document my past dyeing process, so this is my chance to do it now.  

This isn't a do-while-read guide. If you're going to follow in my footsteps, read everything here first.

Before dyeing, we clean the caps thoroughly with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol.

All 46 done.

Now we get ready to boil using this. We boil for about 30 minutes.

Don't forget to use something to suck in toxic fumes while boiling. An open window isn't enough. This shit smells like gasoline and can leave your area smelling nauseating for a couple days. I use a [carbon filter fume-extractor](https://www.amazon.com/Xytronic-0608426DLX-426DLX-Fume-Extractor/dp/B0007ZLH4Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1521116905&sr=8-7&keywords=fume+extractor&dpID=311CqKVeKsL&preST=_QL70_&dpSrc=srch) that I have on hand usually for soldering.

Strain the caps afterwards.

They're bronze colored, but don't be alarmed. It's because there is a lot of sticky excess dye stuck on them.

To get rid of the excess, soap and water isn't enough. We need to soak them in isopropyl alcohol for 24 hours, changing them out every 6-12 hours.

Once all is done, they should be pitch black save for a bit of residue here and there. The residue can be cleaned off with soap and water or another bathing session in alcohol. I got a little excited and put the caps on my keyboard before I could finish cleaning them all (I'll get to it later).
